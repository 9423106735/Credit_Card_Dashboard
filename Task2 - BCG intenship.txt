✅ Task Two – Understand the Business & Frame the Problem
1️⃣ Meet the Client – PowerCo

PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility provider operating in a competitive market.

Their Core Problem:

They are experiencing customer churn (customers switching to competitors).

In the utilities industry:

Margins are thin

Customer acquisition is expensive

Retention is cheaper than acquisition

Small churn % = large revenue loss

So their business question is:

Why are customers leaving, and how can we reduce churn?

2️⃣ Interpreting the Business Context

Before analyzing data, we translate the business issue into an analytical problem.

Business Hypothesis:

PowerCo suspects that price sensitivity is the main driver of churn.

But we must validate:

Is price really the main driver?

Or are contract types, service issues, or tenure more important?

Analytical Goal:

Identify key churn drivers

Quantify impact of each driver

Predict customers at risk

Recommend retention actions

3️⃣ Breaking Down the Problem (Structured Thinking – Very Important for BCG)

Instead of jumping into data, we structure the problem:

Step 1: Define the Target Variable

Churn (Yes/No)

Step 2: Identify Potential Drivers

We can categorize them into:

A) Pricing & Tariff Variables

Electricity price

Gas price

Price changes over time

Discount history

B) Customer Behavior

Consumption patterns

Payment delays

Billing amount changes

C) Contract & Tenure

Contract type (fixed/variable)

Tenure length

Time to contract renewal

D) Service Interaction

Complaints

Customer service calls

E) Demographics / Segment

Region

SME vs residential

Industry type (if B2B)

4️⃣ Client Data Needed for Analysis

To properly investigate churn, we need:

🔹 Customer Information

Customer ID

Segment (SME / Residential)

Region

Tenure

🔹 Pricing & Contract Data

Electricity price

Gas price

Contract type

Discount applied

Date of contract renewal

🔹 Usage Data

Monthly electricity consumption

Monthly gas consumption

🔹 Billing & Financials

Monthly bill amount

Payment behavior

Late payment indicator

🔹 Target Variable

Churn flag (0/1)

Churn date

5️⃣ Analytical Techniques to Investigate the Problem

We will follow a structured analytical approach:

Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculate churn rate

Compare churn vs non-churn customers

Segment churn by:

Price level

Contract type

Tenure buckets

Consumption level

Check correlation between price changes and churn

Goal: Identify patterns & initial drivers

Phase 2: Statistical Testing

Hypothesis testing:

Is churn significantly higher after price increase?

T-tests / Chi-square tests

Feature correlation analysis

Goal: Validate whether price sensitivity is statistically significant

Phase 3: Predictive Modeling

Build churn prediction models:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Evaluate:

Accuracy

Precision/Recall

ROC-AUC

Feature importance

Goal: Identify strongest churn drivers

Phase 4: Business Impact Analysis

Estimate revenue loss from churn

Identify high-value customers at risk

Simulate retention strategy impact

6️⃣ Final Output – Email to Manager (Submission Ready)



Hi,

Following our discussion regarding PowerCo’s customer churn concerns, I have outlined a structured approach to investigate the issue.

**Objective**
The goal is to identify the key drivers of customer churn and determine whether price sensitivity is the primary factor contributing to customer attrition.

**Data Requirements**
To conduct this analysis, we will require customer-level data including:

* Customer demographics and tenure
* Contract type and renewal information
* Electricity and gas pricing details
* Discount history
* Energy consumption data
* Billing and payment behavior
* Churn indicator and churn date

**Analytical Approach**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Measure churn rate across different customer segments
   * Compare pricing, contract types, and consumption between churned and retained customers

2. **Statistical Testing:**

   * Test whether price increases significantly impact churn rates
   * Validate correlations between pricing and churn

3. **Predictive Modeling:**

   * Develop churn prediction models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   * Identify key features influencing churn probability

4. **Business Impact Assessment:**

   * Quantify revenue loss due to churn
   * Identify high-value customers at risk
   * Recommend targeted retention strategies

This approach will allow us to confirm whether price sensitivity is the primary churn driver and provide actionable insights to reduce customer attrition.

Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with the exploratory analysis.

Best regards,
Apurva
