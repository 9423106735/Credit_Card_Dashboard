Step 1 — Understand the Problem
Churn prediction = Classification problem
Target variable:
Churn = Yes / No

Goal:

Predict probability a customer will leave


🧹 Step 2 — Prepare the Data
Clean data before modeling.
✔ Handle Missing Values


Numeric → replace with mean/median


Categorical → replace with mode or “Unknown”


✔ Convert Categorical Variables
Random Forest requires numeric input.
Convert using:


Label Encoding (binary categories)


One-Hot Encoding (multiple categories)


Example:
Gender → Male=0 Female=1
Plan → Basic, Premium → 2 columns


✔ Remove Irrelevant Columns
Drop fields like:


Customer ID


Phone number


Unique identifiers



📉 Step 3 — Split Data
Divide dataset into training and testing sets.
Standard split:
Train = 80%
Test = 20%


🌳 Step 4 — Build Random Forest Model
Why Random Forest?
Because it:


Handles large datasets


Works with non-linear relationships


Reduces overfitting


Automatically finds important variables



Python Implementation (Recommended for Interviews)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, random_state=42)

# Train
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Accuracy
print(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))

# Report
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))


📊 Step 5 — Evaluate Model
Key evaluation metrics interviewers expect:
MetricMeaningAccuracyOverall correct predictionsPrecisionHow many predicted churners actually churnedRecallHow many real churners were caughtF1 ScoreBalance of precision + recall
Important for churn models:
👉 Recall matters most (you don’t want to miss customers about to leave)

🔍 Step 6 — Feature Importance
Random Forest tells which factors cause churn.
import pandas as pd
importance = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=X.columns)
importance.sort_values(ascending=False)

Example Insights:


Contract type = strongest predictor


Monthly charges = high churn risk


Tenure = low tenure → high churn


This is what companies actually care about.

📈 Step 7 — Business Interpretation
Convert results into business insight:
Example conclusion:

Customers with monthly charges > ₹2000 and tenure < 6 months have highest churn risk.

Actionable recommendation:


Offer discount for new customers


Loyalty rewards after 3 months


Personalized retention offers
