Step 1 — Start With Hypothesis Thinking

We don’t create random features. Each feature must test a business hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1 — Price Sensitivity Causes Churn

Create features like:

Price difference

Price change %

Price relative to market

Discount indicator

Hypothesis 2 — Customers Near Contract End Churn More

Create:

Days until contract expiry

Hypothesis 3 — New Customers Churn More

Create:

Customer tenure

Hypothesis 4 — Low Engagement Customers Churn More

Create:

Average consumption

Usage trend

🔷 Step 2 — Load Dataset
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("client_data.csv")

🔷 Step 3 — Create New Features (Core Task Requirement)

Below are the most important engineered features expected for this case study.

⭐ Feature 1 — Price Change Percentage (Most Important)

Measures price sensitivity.

df['price_change_pct'] = (df['new_price'] - df['old_price']) / df['old_price']


Why it matters:

Customers react to price increases, not just price levels.

⭐ Feature 2 — Tenure Length
df['tenure_days'] = (pd.to_datetime('today') - pd.to_datetime(df['date_activ'])).dt.days


Business insight:

Short-tenure customers are less loyal → higher churn risk.

⭐ Feature 3 — Days Until Contract Ends
df['days_to_end'] = (pd.to_datetime(df['date_end']) - pd.to_datetime('today')).dt.days


Why important:

Customers near renewal often switch providers.

⭐ Feature 4 — Average Energy Consumption
df['avg_usage'] = (df['gas_usage'] + df['electricity_usage']) / 2


Insight:

High-usage customers behave differently than low-usage customers.

⭐ Feature 5 — Discount Indicator
df['has_discount'] = (df['discount'] > 0).astype(int)


Business logic:

Discounts may reduce churn probability.

⭐ Feature 6 — Customer Value Score
df['customer_value'] = df['monthly_bill'] * df['tenure_days']


Insight:

Helps identify whether high-value customers churn more or less.

⭐ Feature 7 — Price vs Market Price (Advanced Feature)
df['price_vs_market'] = df['electricity_price'] - df['market_price']


Most powerful feature for testing price competitiveness hypothesis.

🔷 Step 4 — Convert Categorical Variables
df = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)


Reason:
Machine learning models require numeric inputs.

🔷 Step 5 — Scale Numeric Features (For Modeling)
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()

num_cols = ['price_change_pct','tenure_days','days_to_end','avg_usage']

df[num_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(df[num_cols])

🔷 Step 6 — Check Feature Relationships
df.corr()['churn'].sort_values(ascending=False)


This identifies which engineered features correlate most with churn.

📊 Expected Strong Predictors

Typically strongest churn indicators:

Price change %

Days to contract end

Tenure

Contract type

Discount presence

If your analysis shows these → your feature engineering is strong.

📄 Submission Write-Up

Feature Engineering Summary

To better understand customer churn behavior, I engineered several new features designed to capture pricing dynamics, customer lifecycle stage, and engagement patterns.

To test price sensitivity, I created variables including price change percentage and price difference relative to market price. I also developed tenure-based features such as customer tenure and days remaining until contract expiration to evaluate whether customers closer to renewal are more likely to churn.

Additionally, I constructed behavioral features such as average energy consumption and a discount indicator to assess whether customer engagement and incentives influence churn risk. A customer value metric was also created to evaluate whether high-value customers behave differently.

These engineered features provide additional predictive signals beyond the raw dataset and will be used in subsequent modeling steps to identify the most influential drivers of churn.
