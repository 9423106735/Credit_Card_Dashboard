Step 1: Structured EDA Framework (Very Important for BCG)

We don’t randomly explore data.

We use a hypothesis-driven approach:

Hypothesis:

Customers who experience price increases are more likely to churn.

We test this in 4 phases:

Data Cleaning

Univariate Analysis

Bivariate Analysis (Churn vs Variables)

Feature Investigation (Price sensitivity focus)

🔷 Step 2: Data Cleaning (Python)

Assume dataset: client_data.csv

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("client_data.csv")

# View structure
df.info()
df.head()

✅ Check Missing Values
df.isnull().sum()


If missing values:

df = df.dropna()  # or use fillna()

✅ Remove Duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()

✅ Convert Date Columns
df['contract_start_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['contract_start_date'])
df['contract_end_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['contract_end_date'])

🔷 Step 3: Understand Churn Rate
churn_rate = df['churn'].mean()
print("Churn Rate:", churn_rate)

Visualization:
sns.countplot(x='churn', data=df)
plt.title("Churn Distribution")
plt.show()

🔷 Step 4: Investigate Price Sensitivity
A) Compare Average Price (Churn vs Non-Churn)
df.groupby('churn')['electricity_price'].mean()

Visualization:
sns.boxplot(x='churn', y='electricity_price', data=df)
plt.title("Electricity Price vs Churn")
plt.show()

B) Price Change Analysis

If dataset has old vs new price:

df['price_change'] = df['new_price'] - df['old_price']

sns.boxplot(x='churn', y='price_change', data=df)
plt.title("Price Change vs Churn")
plt.show()

🔷 Step 5: Tenure Analysis

Customers who recently joined may churn more.

sns.boxplot(x='churn', y='tenure', data=df)
plt.title("Tenure vs Churn")
plt.show()

🔷 Step 6: Contract Type Impact
sns.countplot(x='contract_type', hue='churn', data=df)
plt.title("Contract Type vs Churn")
plt.show()

🔷 Step 7: Correlation Analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Correlation Matrix")
plt.show()


Check correlation between:

price variables

churn

🔷 Step 8: Statistical Testing (Optional but Impressive)
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

churned = df[df['churn']==1]['electricity_price']
not_churned = df[df['churn']==0]['electricity_price']

ttest_ind(churned, not_churned)


If p-value < 0.05 → price difference statistically significant.

🔷 Step 9: Key Visualizations You Should Create

You must create:

📊 Churn distribution

📊 Electricity price vs churn (boxplot)

📊 Price change vs churn

📊 Tenure vs churn

📊 Contract type vs churn

📊 Correlation heatmap

These show structured thinking.

🔷 Step 10: How to Interpret Results (Example)
Example Insights (Write Something Like This):

Churn rate is X%

Customers with higher electricity prices show slightly higher churn

Price increase appears correlated with churn

However, tenure shows stronger correlation than price

Contract type (variable contracts) have higher churn

🔷 Very Important: Business Interpretation

Even if price is significant:

You must say:

While price appears to influence churn, other factors such as tenure and contract type may also play a significant role. Further modeling is required to quantify feature importance.

BCG likes balanced conclusions.

🔷 What You Should Submit (Write This Summary)

You can paste this in the Forage portal:

📄 Task 3 Summary

I performed exploratory data analysis to investigate whether price sensitivity drives churn. After cleaning the dataset (removing duplicates, handling missing values, converting date columns), I analyzed churn distribution and compared key features across churned and retained customers.

Boxplot analysis shows that customers experiencing higher electricity prices or price increases tend to churn at slightly higher rates. However, tenure and contract type also show significant differences between churned and retained customers.

Correlation analysis indicates that while price variables have some relationship with churn, they are not the only drivers. Statistical testing suggests that price differences are statistically significant, but the magnitude of effect requires further modeling.

Overall, price sensitivity appears to influence churn, but additional predictive modeling is required to determine the most influential factors.
